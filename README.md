# 8080-cosim

Reconstruction of the Soviet/Estonian Juku E5104 processor board as both a
physical PCB and a runnable, headless digital model. The project’s distinctive
piece is an LVS-style check that compares the structural Verilog connectivity
with the machine-readable board model.

## Current result

- The C emulator and the structural `juku_top` model boot the real Juku ROM,
  render the same framebuffer, accept keyboard input, boot EKDOS from the
  vendored disk images, and reach disk BASIC `READY`.
- `sync/check.sh` currently compares 97 mapped instances and 227 nets with no
  KiCad/HDL mismatch.
- The routed main-board artifact has 237 footprints and no KiCad
  clearance/short/unconnected-item errors. Its Gerber/drill ZIP is reproducible
  and internally coherent. Current ZIP SHA256:
  `77f71719133c19470d853b4769e3584df2a2854320a68febb934ea7c25f74424`.
- The main board is **not released for fabrication**. D2 is still physically
  unnetted, D94 lacks its enable/output wiring, and 11 official IC footprints
  (including D30 READY support, D105 wait logic, and FDC glue) have no modeled
  pin connectivity. The D2/D94 PROM contents are also missing, and 36 modeled
  nets retain source-risk annotations requiring evidence or explicit redesign.
  See [PLAN.md](PLAN.md).

That last distinction matters: a clean DRC and a green LVS prove only the
connectivity represented in those checks. They do not prove omitted pins,
unmodeled footprints, reconstructed PROM contents, or analog/timing assumptions.

## Evidence and source hierarchy

1. Factory drawings, board photographs, dumps, and owner measurements under
   `ref/` are the historical evidence.
2. `kicad/juku.board.json` is the current machine-readable connectivity model.
3. `kicad/juku.kicad_sch`, the PCB files, and fabrication outputs are derived
   from or checked against that model.
4. `hdl/juku_top.v` is independently maintained structural Verilog and is
   checked against the modeled connectivity by `sync/`.
5. `cosim/` and the current upstream MAME Juku driver are behavioral oracles;
   they are not substitutes for missing physical wiring evidence.

  policy.
- [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) — model boundaries and data flow.
- [docs/source-coverage-audit.md](docs/source-coverage-audit.md) — adopted
  external evidence and remaining source gaps.

  — fabrication-package integrity and the current design hold.

## Quick checks

```sh
sync/check.sh
sync/boot_check.sh
sync/cosim_check.sh
python3 scripts/check_documentation_consistency.py
```

The long reset-to-EKDOS/BASIC and Monitor 3.3 diagnostics are intentionally
separate from the fast default checks; `sync/README.md` identifies their entry
points.
