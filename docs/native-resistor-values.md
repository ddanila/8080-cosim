# Native schematic resistor values

Status: **24 VALUES SOURCE-CLOSED / 0 TARGET HOLDS**

The native electrical sheets and target-board photos close 24 values that
were formerly blank in the machine-readable board model. This report checksum-guards those sources,
checks the board JSON and generated source PCB agree, and keeps ambiguous or
revision-sensitive values out of the promoted set.

## Deliberate holds

None. Every modeled axial resistor now has literal source evidence.

## Evidence boundary

- Sheet 1 closes R11-R14 and R17 directly; these are not values inferred
  from open-collector behavior.
- Sheet 2 closes the R40-R45 common 15 kΩ group, correcting stale 13 kΩ
  prose, plus the D56, FRAME_INT, video-summing, and beeper networks.
- The factory-identified target R67 body reads `4K7` independently in July
  and May views. This supersedes the `.006` sheet's 2 kΩ R67 value without
  promoting the target part's still-unresolved pin-2 destination.
- Connectivity is unchanged. This milestone only replaces absent value
  metadata with literal scan/photo evidence.
- R48's `8,2 Ом` label is independently corroborated by the traced beeper
  boundary. No modeled axial resistor remains unvalued.
