# Native schematic resistor values

Status: **24 VALUES SOURCE-CLOSED / 1 TARGET HOLD**

The native electrical sheets and target-board photos close 24 values that
were formerly blank in the machine-readable board model. This report checksum-guards those sources,
checks the board JSON and generated source PCB agree, and keeps ambiguous or
revision-sensitive values out of the promoted set.

## Deliberate holds

| Ref | Why it remains unvalued |
| --- | --- |
| `R78` | Recovered .009 Э3 sheet 3 proves the D106 preset/UP pull-up role and +5 V endpoint, but its value marking and physical body are not readable in the available source set. |

## Evidence boundary

- Sheet 1 closes R11-R14 and R17 directly; these are not values inferred
  from open-collector behavior.
- Sheet 2 closes the R40-R45 common 15 kΩ group, correcting stale 13 kΩ
  prose, plus the D56, FRAME_INT, video-summing, and beeper networks.
- The factory-identified target R67 body reads `4K7` independently in July
  and May views. This supersedes the `.006` sheet's 2 kΩ R67 value without
  promoting the target part's still-unresolved pin-2 destination.
- R78 connectivity is source-closed separately, but its value and physical
  placement remain held rather than guessed.
- R48's `8,2 Ом` label is independently corroborated by the traced beeper
  boundary. R78 is the sole modeled axial resistor still unvalued.
