# Unmodeled footprint inventory

Status: **DESIGN HOLD / FUNCTIONAL FOOTPRINTS UNMODELED**

This generated report catches IC footprints that exist in the generated
PCB/DSN artifacts but are not yet part of `kicad/juku.board.json`.
These parts are placement-only in the current engineering package:
promoting any of them to modeled nets changes the netlist and requires
a routed-PCB refresh plus endpoint-coverage proof.

## Command

```sh
python3 scripts/report_unmodeled_footprint_inventory.py
```

## Summary

- Modeled board-JSON `D*` ICs: `96`
- Source PCB IC footprints: `106`
- Routed PCB IC footprints: `106`
- DSN IC placements: `106`
- Footprint-only ICs in any PCB/DSN artifact: `10`
- Footprint-only ICs present in source PCB, routed PCB, and DSN: `10`

## Design-Release Consequence

There are `10` IC footprints in PCB/DSN artifacts with no
pin-level representation in board JSON. KiCad's zero-unconnected result
cannot detect missing connections on placement-only footprints. Every row
below therefore blocks design release until it is either modeled and routed
or explicitly dispositioned as a redesign/DNP and removed from the released
PCB artifacts. Closing D105 alone is not sufficient.

## D105 Wait-Gate Boundary

- D105 inventory state: `PENDING MODEL + REROUTE`
- `D105` is an official `.009` `К155ЛА3` footprint present in
  `kicad/gen_kicad_pcb.py`, `kicad/juku.dsn`, `kicad/juku.kicad_pcb`,
  and `kicad/juku_routed.kicad_pcb`, but absent from
  `kicad/juku.board.json`.
- Existing sheet-1 evidence narrows the first useful closure to the
  wait-state chain: D2 `DO`/pin 12 feeds D105 pin 9; D105 has the two
  visible NAND sections `(9,10)->8` and `(4,5)->6`; D2 `V1/V2` are tied
  to ground. The same sheet also shows D105 `(1,2)->3` with D13.4 and
  MWR inputs, plus `(12,13)->11` used as an MRD inverter.
- Do not promote D105 into board JSON from this partial read alone. The
  remaining automatic/owner work is to trace the D105.10 `H` source and
  the D105.6 destination, then rerun PCB generation/routing so both
  source and routed PCB pad nets match the model.

## D30 READY Flip-Flop Boundary

- The full-resolution sheet-1 source proves D30 section A: pin 4 `/PRE`
  and pin 2 `D` are pulled high, pin 3 `CLK` is `PHI2TTL`, pin 1
  `/CLR` is driven by `-SSTB`, and pin 5 `Q` reaches D1 READY/pin 23
  through R29 1 kΩ.
- D30 section A, R5, R6, and R29 are now promoted into board JSON. In section
  B, the local U-shaped wire proves that pin 10 `/PRE` and pin 12 `D` share a
  net; pins 6 `/Q1` and 9 `Q2` are not drawn and are recorded as intentional
  no-connects. Pin 8 `/Q2`, pin 11 `CLK`, pin 13 `/CLR`, and the upstream source
  of the pin-10/pin-12 net still require clean end-to-end reads. The footprint
  is no longer placement-only, but design release remains blocked until those
  endpoints are traced and the regenerated route is verified.

## Closure Rule

1. Keep placement-only official footprints here until their pins are
   traceable enough to add to `kicad/juku.board.json`.
2. After board JSON promotion, regenerate PCB/DSN/BOM reports and route
   the affected pads before claiming endpoint coverage.
3. D105 has first priority because it is tied to D2's wait-state PROM
   output and CPU wait behavior; D30 READY support and the FDC support
   cluster still require their own complete dispositions.
4. `READY FOR DESIGN RELEASE` is emitted only when no IC footprint
   remains outside the board-JSON pin model.
